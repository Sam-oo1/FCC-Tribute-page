        <h3 class="info-heading">Here' the timeline and great work of Albert Einstein.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="year">1879</span>  - Born on 14 March 1879 Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire</li>
            <li><span class="year">1895 </span> - At the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1900 </span> - Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal teaching diploma.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1905</span> - Annus Mirabilis papers. The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory),
            Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik
            scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed
            views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are:</li>
            <li><span class="year">1911</span>  - Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907
            article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of
            general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1916</span> - Einstein predicted gravitational waves,ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves,
            traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1917</span> - Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He
            discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1921</span> - He was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1922</span> - He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his
            discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</li>
            <li><span class="year">1935</span> - Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges.</li>
            <li><span class="year">1955</span> - dies at the age of 76.</li>
